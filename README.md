Final Project
Background: I work at a Group Home where we use papers as a form of communication. At the end of every shift, 
staff members would have to document what happened during the 8 hours in a form called; Communication Log. 
One of the problems of this method is that the information written on the communication log(s) remains at 
the place of work. Senior management and other staff members of the company do not have access to this 
information unless they visit the residence. What I try to do in this project is to create an online form 
that staff members can fill at the end of the shift and submit this information for everyone to see at a 
timely manner. This End of Shift Report will be completed by an assigned staff member at the end of every 
shift and submitted for all to see. This will provide timely information and prompt timely response.
After entering the command “cd final_project” and following the link, it will take you to the sign-in 
page, Enter the username and password (you can enter anything for username and password for this project), 
and you will be directed to the form.  This form has a lot of checks to ensure that all information is
entered correctly. After entering all the information, you can click the submit button.  The name of the 
organization and residences are fictitious.
